# House-Price-Valuator

In this Project, I have used the dataset of American Houses and then performed data cleaning on it. I had various attributes like location,BHK,Area and many other features in the dataset. Data cleaning was a difficult process and after that I have used scikit learn to perform model training. I got 85% accuracy on the test dataset.
